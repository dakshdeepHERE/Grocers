# Grocers

This was a basic app that I built, and here I implemented the Bloc Logics that I've learned recently. I have implemented bloc for each feature that I had in this app from wishlist button to cart screen. All of them are implemented using Bloc. Overall it was a great learning experience and I will create more projects based on Bloc Logics in future.
